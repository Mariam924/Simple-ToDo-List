# Simple To-Do List Website


The "To Do List" is a simple website that allows users to manage their tasks. It is built using HTML for the structure, and JavaScript for the functionality. This is a basic implementation of a "To Do List":

- **Adding Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button. Each task is added as a new list item in an ordered list.

- **Deleting Tasks**: Each task has a delete button next to it. Users can delete a task by clicking this button. The task will then be removed from the list.

- **Updating Tasks**: Users can update any task by clicking on the task text. This will allow them to edit the text directly in the list. After editing, they can press enter to save the changes.

- **Completing Tasks**: Each task has a checkmark next to it. Users can mark a task as completed by clicking this checkbtn. The task will then be crossed out, indicating that it has been completed.

- **Saving Tasks**: The list of tasks is automatically saved in the local storage of the user‚Äôs browser. This means that even if the user closes the browser or turns off their computer, the tasks will still be there when they come back. This feature makes the ‚ÄúTo Do List‚Äù more reliable and user-friendly.

- **Language Toggle**: The application includes a language toggle feature that allows users to switch between Arabic and English. This feature enhances the user experience by providing a localized interface. The language setting is also saved in local storage, so the user‚Äôs choice is remembered across sessions.
